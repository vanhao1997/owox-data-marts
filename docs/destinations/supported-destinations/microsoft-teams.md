# Microsoft Teams

Configure **Microsoft Teams** as a Destination in P2PDigital Data Marts to allow business users to receive messages with Insights based on the results of each Data Mart run.  

For example, you may want to notify a stakeholder in a Teams channel every time a scheduled run produces updated data (such as new results from the Facebook Ads connector). You can also choose to receive a message only when the run result is empty.

## Configuration Steps

Follow the steps below to configure your **Microsoft Teams** destination.

### Step 1. Create a Destination

#### 1.1. Open the Destinations page

In the P2PDigital Data Marts web application, open **Destinations** in the main menu and click **+ New Destination**.

#### 1.2. Select the Destination type

Choose **Microsoft Teams** from the **Destination Type** dropdown.

#### 1.3. Configure Destination details

- **Title**: Enter a unique name for the Destination (for example, “Marketing Team”).  
- **Microsoft Teams channel emails list**: Add recipient emails or Teams channel email addresses separated by commas, semicolons, or new lines  
  (for example: `yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com@emea.teams.ms`).

#### 1.4. Save the Destination

Review the details and click **Save** to create the Destination.

### Step 2. Create a Report for this Destination

For each Destination, you can create as many reports as needed and configure different schedules for them.

#### 2.1. Open the Data Mart page

Go to your **Data Mart** and open the **Destinations** tab.

#### 2.2. Add a new report

In the block labeled with the name of your Destination, click **+ Add report**.

#### 2.3. Configure general settings

Enter a report title and make sure the report is assigned to the correct Destination.  
You can also view and copy the list of report recipients.

#### 2.4. Configure the template

Write your **Message** using Markdown.  
Switch to **Preview** to check how the Teams message will appear to recipients.

#### 2.5. Set sending conditions

Decide when the report should be sent based on the Data Mart run result:

- **Send always** – the report is sent after every run.  
- **Send only when result is empty** – the report is sent only if the Data Mart returns no data.  
- **Send only when result is not empty** – the report is sent only if the Data Mart returns data.

OWOX automatically runs the Data Mart before sending the report and checks the result. Your selected condition determines whether the message is sent.

#### 2.6. Save the report

Click **Save** to apply the report settings.

#### 2.7. (Optional) Scheduling

To run this report automatically on a schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes or every Monday and Wednesday at 15:00), open the **Triggers** tab and create a new trigger.  
Select this report and specify the schedule for automatic execution.
