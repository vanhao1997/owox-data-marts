# Google BigQuery

## 1. Go to the Storages Page

In the P2PDigital Data Marts web application, navigate to **Storages** from the main navigation pane and click **+ New Storage**.

## 2. Choose Storage Type

Click **Google BigQuery** to create a new **Storage** configuration.
> ☝️ Upon selecting the **+ New Storage** button and specifying the desired storage type, a Storage entry is created.

> Note that **Data Mart** cannot be validated or published until the associated **Storage** is fully configured.

## 3. Add title

Give the storage configuration a clear **title**, eg `P2PDigital Data Marts – Your Name`.

## 4. Set General Settings and Connection Details

### Enter Project ID

- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Click the project selector dropdown at the top

### Choose Authentication Method

P2PDigital Data Marts supports two authentication methods for BigQuery:

#### Option A: Service Account (JSON Key)

To get the JSON key, you'll need to create or use an existing service account in Google Cloud.

> ✅ **Best Practice:** Always use a dedicated service account with least-privilege access for security and auditability.

##### How to obtain the service account key

- Go to the [Service Accounts page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
- Navigate to **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts**
- Create a new account or choose an existing one
- Assign the roles:
  - `BigQuery Data Editor`
  - `BigQuery Job User`
- Go to the **Keys** tab, click **Add key → Create new key**
- Choose **JSON**, click **Create**, and download the file
- Copy the contents of the JSON file and paste it into the **Service Account JSON** field

#### Option B: Google OAuth

Click **Connect Google Account** to authenticate using your personal Google account via OAuth. You will be redirected to Google's consent screen to grant BigQuery access. Once authorized, your account will be linked to this Storage.

> **Note:** The authenticated Google account must have `BigQuery Data Editor` (`roles/bigquery.dataEditor`) and `BigQuery Job User` (`roles/bigquery.jobUser`) roles in the target project. Check or assign these roles in [IAM & Admin → IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam). OAuth tokens are automatically refreshed. If your session expires or access is revoked, you can reconnect at any time.

### Enable BigQuery API

- Open the [BigQuery API Library page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/bigquery.googleapis.com)
- Ensure the correct Google Cloud project is selected
- If the API isn’t enabled, click **Enable**
- If already enabled, you’ll see the API dashboard

## 5. Finalize Setup

Review your entries and click **Save** to add the **Storage configuration**, or **Cancel** to exit without saving.
