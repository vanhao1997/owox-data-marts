# Managing Project Members

Project members are people who have access to your project. Each member has a role that controls what they can do — see [Roles and Permissions](roles-and-permissions.md).

In OWOX projects, only **Project Admins** manage the member list (invite, role change, remove) from **Project Settings → Members**.

> ☝️ Notification receivers are synchronized with the current member list and role eligibility. If a member is removed, or downgraded from **Technical User** to **Business User**, they are removed from receiver lists.

## User Provisioning

User Provisioning controls what happens when a new user from the same corporate domain signs in to an OWOX-managed project.

The setting is configured per BI project in **Project Settings → Members**. It is available for OWOX-managed identity provider projects that are linked to an Organization.

### Automatic provisioning

- New users whose corporate domain matches the Organization domain are added to the Organization main project automatically.
- The **Default Role** setting controls the project role assigned to those users.
- The default access scope is **Entire Project**.
- Project Admins can choose **Selected Contexts** and select particular contexts. This context scope is applied inside P2PDigital Data Marts and is not stored in analytics.

### Manual provisioning

- New users whose corporate domain matches the Organization domain are signed in to the Organization main project with no project roles.
- They can open only the **Request access to existing project** page until a Project Admin approves their request.
- On that page, they can request a role for the main project or create a separate project instead.
- Creating a separate project lets the user continue working while the access request is pending.

Public email domains are ignored for Organization matching. For Google sign-in, the verified hosted domain is preferred when it is available; otherwise OWOX falls back to the user's email domain. Email and Microsoft sign-in use the email domain fallback.

## Created By

Resources keep a creator reference (`Created By`) that does not change after creation.

This applies to Data Marts, Storages, Destinations, Reports, Scheduled Triggers, and Runs.

**Where it appears:**

- **Data Marts, Storages, Destinations, Reports**: sortable `Created By` column in list views, and in the **Details** section of each resource's page
- **Run history**: inline `by [member name]` when a creator profile is available

## Initial Ownership

By default, creator and initial owner are the same:

- Data Mart → creator becomes **Technical Owner**
- Storage → creator becomes **Owner**
- Destination → creator becomes **Owner**
- Report → creator becomes **Owner**

When creating a Storage, Destination, or Report, you can assign owners directly during setup instead of relying on the default.

Scheduled Triggers do not have dedicated ownership. Access to them follows the same rules as their parent Data Mart or Report.

## Member Removal Impact

When a member leaves the project:

- Resources are not deleted.
- The **Created By** record is kept — it is never deleted.
- The member's name is no longer shown in the interface; the **Created By** field displays `—` instead.
