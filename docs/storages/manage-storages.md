# Storage Management

Storages are specialized Data Sources that provide an SQL interface for querying and caching data.  

_IMPORTANT: P2PDigital Data Marts does not retain your data, ensuring that data ownership, storage, and processing control remain under the control of the Data Analyst._

Each project requires at least one **Storage** to be configured to manage and process your data.

If managing multiple clients or teams, you may also want to have multiple **storage configurations** to isolate access.

## Adding a New Storage

To configure a new **Storage**:

1. Navigate to the **Storages** in the left sidebar and click on **+ New Storage**.
2. Then select the **data warehouse** you want to add and follow the instructions for your platform:
    - [Google BigQuery](supported-storages/google-bigquery.md)
    - [AWS Athena](supported-storages/aws-athena.md)
    - [AWS Redshift](supported-storages/aws-redshift.md)
    - [Snowflake](supported-storages/snowflake.md)
    - [Databricks](supported-storages/databricks.md)
    - Azure Synapse (Coming soon)
3. Fill in the required configuration fields based on the selected data warehouse. Follow the instructions for your platform.
4. Click **Save** to complete storage setup or **Cancel** to finish the configuration later.

> ☝️ Upon selecting the **+ New Storage** button and specifying the desired storage type, a Storage entry is created.
> You can create **Data Mart** entities and model a data structure for your project prior to configuring the **Storage**.  
> Note that **Data Mart** cannot be validated or published until the associated **Storage** is fully configured.

## Removing a Storage

To remove an existing **Storage** configuration:

1. Ensure all associated **Data Marts** linked to this **Storage** are deleted first. To do this:
   - Navigate to the **Data Marts** page in the P2PDigital Data Marts web application.
   - Identify and select all Data Marts associated with the Storage you intend to remove.
   - Click the **Delete** button above the Data Marts table and confirm the deletion.
2. Go to the **Storages** page via the main navigation pane.
3. Locate the **Storage** you want to delete in the table, click the item actions menu (represented by **...**), and click **Delete**.
4. Confirm the deletion to remove the Storage.

> ☝️ Attempting to delete a **Storage** with associated Data Marts will result in the error: "Cannot delete the storage because it is referenced by existing data marts".  
> Ensure all dependencies are removed before proceeding.

## Managing Owners

Each Storage has an **Owners** list — the team members responsible for its configuration and credentials.

- When a new Storage is created, the **creator is automatically assigned as an owner**.
- You can add or remove owners in the Storage configuration sheet (the **Owners** field in the General section).
- Only project members can be assigned as owners.
- Owners are saved together with the rest of the Storage configuration when you click **Save**.
- You can filter Storages by owner in the list view using the **Owners** filter.

> ☝️ Ownership is currently informational — it does not affect access control. Any user with edit access can modify any Storage regardless of ownership.

## Key Considerations

- Each **Data Mart** requires a single **Storage** association. Verify your selection during **Data Mart** setup.
- For additional guidance or troubleshooting, explore the supported **Storage** configuration pages or join the [OWOX Community](https://github.com/vanhao1997/p2pdigital-data-marts/discussions).
