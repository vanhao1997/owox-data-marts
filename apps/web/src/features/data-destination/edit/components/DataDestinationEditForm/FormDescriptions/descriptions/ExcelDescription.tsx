          There is nothing to set up here. The P2PDigital add-in for Excel creates this destination for
          you the first time you build a report from a workbook.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-2'>
          Unlike other destinations, it stores no credentials: the add-in reads your data using your
          own P2PDigital access, and writes it into the worksheet you opened it from.
        </p>
      </AccordionContent>
    </AccordionItem>
