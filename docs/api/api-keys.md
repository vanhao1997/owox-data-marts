# API Keys

API keys let external tools authenticate with P2PDigital Data Marts without an interactive browser session.

Use API keys with:

- [owox-ctl](./owox-ctl/)
- [@owox/api-client](./api-client/)
- CI and automation scripts
- AI agents
- custom scripts and internal tools

Each API key is one secret value that starts with `owox_key_`.
The API key is shown only when the key is created. Store the full value securely.

API Key ID is a non-secret identifier that starts with `pmk_`, for example
`pmk_AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv`. It is used in status output, logs, support, and
debugging. You do not need to copy it separately for setup.

API keys are associated with project member access. Available data and actions
depend on the permissions granted to the project member who owns the key.

For self-managed deployments, set `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to the actual public URL before
creating API keys. The origin is included in the API key, so keys created with a
`localhost` fallback will not work from external tools.

## Create an API key

1. Open your P2PDigital Data Marts project.
2. In the project menu, open **Project settings → My API Keys**.
3. Click **Create API Key**.
4. Enter a **Name**.
5. Set **Expires** if the key should have an expiration date.
6. Click **Create**.
7. In the **API Key Created** dialog, copy the **API Key**.
8. Store the API key securely.
9. Click **I have saved the API Key**.

The API key is shown only once.

Do not share API keys in chat, email, screenshots, support tickets, prompts, or repository files.

## Use an API key

After creating an API key, use it with one of the supported API access options:

- [owox-ctl](./owox-ctl/) for terminal, CI, automation, and AI agent workflows that need JSON command output.
- [@owox/api-client](./api-client/) for TypeScript or JavaScript integrations.
- [OpenAPI and Swagger UI](./openapi/#raw-http-api-contract) for inspecting the raw HTTP API contract.

## Revoke or rotate API keys

1. Open **Project settings → My API Keys**.
2. Find the API key.
3. Open the row actions menu.
4. Click **Revoke**.
5. In the **Revoke API Key** dialog, click **Revoke**.

After an API key is revoked, tools using that key can no longer authenticate.

Rotate a key by creating a new API key, updating the tool or automation that uses it, and revoking the old key.

## Security recommendations

- Create separate API keys for different users, tools, or automation contexts.
- Do not commit API keys to Git.
- Do not store API keys in prompts, AI agent instruction files, screenshots, or support tickets.
- Prefer environment variables or secret managers for CI and AI agents.
- Revoke keys that are no longer used.
- Rotate keys if the secret may have been exposed.
