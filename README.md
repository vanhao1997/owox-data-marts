# P2PDigital Data Marts

## Your AI Reporting Data Analyst — Open Source

Stop shipping reports. Hire a reporting data analyst for each of the team members.
P2PDigital Data Marts automates what reporting data analysts do — governed by data teams, consumed by business users with NO AI Hallycinations.

## ✨ Why We Built This

Data analysts’ work means nothing unless business users can play with the data freely.

However, most **self-service analytics** initiatives fail because they compromise either the data analysts’ control or the business users’ freedom.

At P2PDigital, we value both:

- Data analysts **orchestrate data marts** defined either by [SQL](./docs/getting-started/setup-guide/sql-data-mart.md) or by [connectors](./docs/getting-started/setup-guide/connector-data-mart.md) to sources like Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, and LinkedIn Ads.
- Business users **enjoy trusted reports** right [where they want them](./docs/destinations/manage-destinations.md) — in spreadsheets or dashboards.

At P2PDigital, we believe data analysts shouldn’t have to waste time on CSV files and one-off dashboards. Business users shouldn’t have to be forced to use complex BI tools either.

## The Reporting Skills P2PDigital Automates

We analyzed **1,438 job postings** for reporting data analysts at US ecommerce SMBs. Here's what companies pay $70–120k/yr for — and what P2PDigital handles out of the box:

| Skill | % of Job Listings | How P2PDigital handles It |
|-------|:-----------------:|---------------------|
| Writing & maintaining SQL queries | ~95% | Create data marts from SQL, tables, views, or patterns — version-controlled and reusable |
| Integrating data from multiple sources | ~85% | Open-source connectors (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok, Shopify, etc.) with zero data engineering |
| Building & maintaining dashboards and reports | ~80% | Publish data marts to Google Sheets, Looker Studio, Slack, email — one source, many outputs |
| Scheduling refreshes and timely delivery | ~70% | Built-in scheduler for data marts and exports — set once, runs forever |
| Enabling stakeholder self-service | ~65% | Business users browse the data mart library in Google Sheets, pick columns, apply filters — no tickets |
| Managing data access and permissions | ~40% | Ownership, context-based access, technical and business owners on every data mart |

**What stays with your analysts** (and becomes more valuable): data integrity validation, business logic mapping, variance diagnosis, metric definitions and standardization, stakeholder requests translation, and orchestrating AI-assisted workflows.

## Why Teams Choose OWOX Over Alternatives

### 1. No AI Hallucinations. Ever

> *"Even one hallucination is too many in this line of work."*
> — u/Cynot88, r/dataengineering

Most "AI analytics" tools generate numbers from LLM guesses. P2PDigital AI Insights run **pre-approved SQL your analyst manages**. AI helps with narrative prose, not the numbers. Every value is the result of a deterministic SQL query — not a prediction. Backed by [patented technology](https://www.p2pdigital.vn?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).

**Why it matters:**

- Specialized legal AI tools hallucinate 17%+ of the time; general-purpose chatbots hit 58–82% ([Stanford HAI, 2025](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/basics/addressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias/))
- 46% of developers actively distrust AI tool accuracy (Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2025)
- EU AI Act (effective August 2025) mandates traceable logic on every AI insight used in significant decisions — fines up to €35M

### 2. No Semantic Layer Required

> *"The semantic layer is fragmented between tools, suffers from vendor lock-in and requires duplicate encoding of business logic that is costly to maintain... making adoption economically unviable for many firms."*
> — Semantic Layer Substack

Skip the 6–12 month semantic layer implementation. Plug in your existing SQL and ship. Business users get self-service in minutes, not quarters.

**Why it matters:**

- Production-ready semantic layer typically take 6–12 months for enterprise teams ([Datacoves, 2026](https://datacoves.com/post/dbt-core-key-differences))
- Only 27% of teams plan to increase semantic layer investment ([dbt Labs State of Analytics Engineering, 2025](https://www.getdbt.com/resources/state-of-analytics-engineering-2025))
- Of the 30% using AI to consume data via natural language, two-thirds do so with vanilla SQL generation — not via a semantic layer

### 3. Data Stays in Your Warehouse

> *"I didn't get an error message — instead I got a column that is entirely blank. No zeroes, just blank all the way down."*
> — Supermetrics customer, Community Forum, July 2025 (after Meta cut historical data access)

Your data never leaves your infrastructure. Once normalized into your warehouse, it stays — immune to upstream API deprecations. Open-source core means no vendor lock-in.

**Why it matters:**

- Meta cut historical data on unique-count fields to 13 months and removed 7/28-day attribution windows entirely ([Supermetrics docs, Jan 2026](https://docs.supermetrics.com/docs/facebook-ads-new-historical-limitations-attribution-window-and-metric-removals-january-12-2026))
- 53.7% of CDOs serve less than 3 years; boards hold data leaders personally accountable for compliance and vendor risk ([MIT Sloan, 2025](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-chief-data-officer-role-whats-next/))

## Who Is OWOX For?

| | Data Analysts | Business Users | C-Suite |
|---|---|---|---|

| **OWOX gives you** | Define once, publish everywhere. Full SQL audit trail. Stay in control. | Self-serve from a governed data mart library in Google Sheets — no SQL, no tickets | Visible value in weeks. Auditable accuracy. No vendor lock-in. Open-source core. |

## 🗣️ What People Are Saying

> *"Connected BigQuery, set up 37 data marts, built a data model and had live reports in Sheets in under 15 minutes.
My team thought I was joking when I showed them how they can now get live reports right in their sheets."*
> *"We migrated 200+ reports from Looker to P2PDigital Data Marts. Our team now self-serves without filing a single Jira ticket.
Easily the best infrastructure decision we made this year."*
> *"75% of CDAOs who fail to demonstrate AI's positive impact will be reassigned or removed from the C-suite by 2027."*
> — Gartner, via TechRadar, November 2025

## How it works

1. **Analysts define** data marts using SQL, existing tables/views, or connectors
2. **P2PDigital governs** — ownership, descriptions, aliases, join keys, access controls, and scheduling
3. **Business users consume** — browse the data mart library in Google Sheets, pick columns, apply filters, get live data
4. **AI Insights narrate** — pre-approved SQL generates numbers; AI writes the prose; delivered to Slack, Teams, email
