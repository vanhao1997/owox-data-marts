# Web Application

This is the web interface for P2PDigital Data Marts - an open-source solution for Data Analysts. This web application provides a user-friendly interface for managing Data Marts.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: v19.1.0 - UI library for building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: v5.7.3 - For type-safe JavaScript development
- **Tailwind CSS**: v4.1.8 - For utility-first styling
- **Vite**: v6.3.5 - For fast development and optimized builds
- **Node.js packages**: Various dependencies for UI components and development tools

## Project Structure

The project follows a monorepo structure using npm workspaces.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanhao1997/p2pdigital-data-marts.git
   cd owox-data-marts
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server:

```bash
# From the root directory to run all workspaces:
npm run dev

# Or to run just the web app:
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is already in use).

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
# From the root directory:
cd apps/web
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `apps/web/dist` directory.

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint with automatic fixes
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check code formatting
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build

## Error Handling

The app uses React Router `errorElement` to catch runtime errors and display a user-friendly fallback instead of the default React crash screen.

There are two error boundary components in `src/components/errors/`:

- **`RootErrorBoundary`** — full-page fallback when `MainLayout` itself crashes (uses a plain `<a href="/">` since the router may be broken).
- **`LayoutErrorBoundary`** — in-layout fallback when a child page crashes. The sidebar stays visible so users can navigate away without reloading.

### Dev-only error details

Both components include a collapsible block that shows the error message and stack trace:

```tsx
{import.meta.env.DEV && error instanceof Error && (
  <details>
    <summary>Error details</summary>
    <pre>{error.message}{'\n\n'}{error.stack}</pre>
  </details>
)}
```

| Part | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `import.meta.env.DEV` | Vite built-in — `true` during `npm run dev`, `false` in production builds. Vite statically replaces it at build time, so the entire block is tree-shaken out of the production bundle. |
| `error instanceof Error` | TypeScript type guard — ensures `.message` and `.stack` are safely accessible. Non-`Error` throws (e.g. strings, Response objects) skip this block. |
| `<details>` / `<summary>` | Native HTML disclosure widget — collapsed by default, click to expand. No JS needed. |

In production, users see only the friendly message and action buttons. In development, developers can expand the details to see the full stack trace inline without opening browser DevTools.
