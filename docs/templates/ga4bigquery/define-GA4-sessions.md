# GA4 Sessions Data Mart - One Row Per Session

This SQL defines **Sessions in GA4 in a clean and reusable way**, using the GA4 BigQuery export data.

Let's collect GA4 events into Sessions.
If you build reports without defining your session logic centrally, every dashboard ends up telling a different story.

This script standardizes event sessionization logic into a **single, reusable Data Mart**:

- One row = one session
- Includes session identifiers
- Visitor identifiers
- Session landing page
- Date & timestamp
- Captures traffic source information
- Geo, location, device, consent - everything you might ever need to analyze

Use this as the foundation for reporting in:

- Google Sheets  
- Data Studio  
- Tableau / Power BI  
- AI assistants and analytics workflows  

> **Tip:** Create a Data Mart in [P2PDigital Data Marts](https://www.p2pdigital.vn/app-signup), paste this SQL, and reuse it across destinations — no more copying queries between dashboards.
