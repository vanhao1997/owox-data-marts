# Google BigQuery (used in OWOX extension)

**Google BigQuery (used in OWOX extension)** is a system storage that appears automatically in P2PDigital Data Marts if you have created Data Marts using **[OWOX Reports (Google Sheets extension)](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/owox_bigquery_data_marts/263000453832)**.

This storage connects your existing Data Marts from the extension to the P2PDigital Data Marts web interface. It allows you to complete a one-time setup, publish your Data Marts, and manage them using additional capabilities available in P2PDigital Data Marts.

> ☝️ You cannot manually add or delete this storage.

## Finish Setting Up the Storage

If you see your extension Data Marts listed with the **Draft** status, this is expected.

They remain in Draft because P2PDigital Data Marts requires a one-time BigQuery access configuration. After you complete the storage setup, you can publish your Data Marts and start using them in the web interface.

Follow the steps below to finish the setup.

### Step 1. Review the Storage Settings

In the P2PDigital Data Marts web application, navigate to **Storages**.  
In the list, find all storages with the type **Google BigQuery (used in OWOX extension)** and open each one to review and complete its settings.

You will see the following fields:

- **Title** – The title is fixed and matches your GCP project ID.  
- **Storage Type** – Google BigQuery (used in OWOX extension).  
- **Project ID** – The project ID is fixed and cannot be changed.

A separate system storage is created for each GCP project used with the OWOX extension. These fields are locked to ensure stable integration between the extension and P2PDigital Data Marts.

If you need to work with a different GCP project, create a new storage.

### Step 2. Set the Location

By default, **Auto-detect location** is selected. We recommend keeping this setting unless you experience region-related query issues.

### Step 3. Add a Service Account

To enable access to your BigQuery project, you must provide a Service Account JSON key.

#### Required roles

> ☝️ The service account must have the `bigquery.dataEditor` and `bigquery.jobUser` roles. These roles allow read, write, and job execution access to your project resources.

#### How to get a Service Account JSON key

1. Go to **[Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)**.
2. Open **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts**.
3. Create a new service account or select an existing one.
4. Assign the required roles: `bigquery.dataEditor` and `bigquery.jobUser`.
5. Open the **Keys** tab.
6. Click **Add key → Create new key**.
7. Choose **JSON** format and click **Create**.
8. Open the downloaded file, copy its entire content, and paste it into the Service Account field in P2PDigital Data Marts.

Save the storage settings.

### Step 4. Publish Your Existing Data Marts

After completing the storage setup, your extension Data Marts connected to this storage can be published. You can publish them individually or manage multiple Data Marts using batch actions.

Once published, your Data Marts become fully operational in P2PDigital Data Marts.

## What You Can Do with Extension Data Marts

After connecting your storage, you can manage your extension Data Marts using additional features available in P2PDigital Data Marts:

- Export Data Mart results not only to Google Sheets, but also to Data Studio, Slack, Email, and other supported destinations.
- Run Data Marts on a schedule.
- Add descriptions and define aliases for fields in the output schema.
- Discover insights using AI based on your Data Mart data.
- Manage multiple Data Marts more efficiently using batch actions.
- Create new Data Marts and load data from additional sources such as Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, and X Ads directly into your data warehouse.
