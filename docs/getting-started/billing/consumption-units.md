# Consumption Units

## P2PDigital Data Marts Terms of Use

[P2PDigital Data Marts](../../../README.md) is a self-service data analytics platform that allows organizations to create a data mart library and empower business users with spreadsheet reports and dashboards — in minutes.

> Consumption Units apply whenever you use the [Cloud edition](../../editions/owox-cloud-editions.md) or cloud-only capabilities
>
> Two types of consumption units cover all available features:
>
> - Report Run
> - Process Run

## Report Run

### **How Are Report Runs Calculated?**

A **Report Run** means pushing or pulling data (stored in **Storage**) to a **Destination**. Reading data through the HTTP Data API or the [MCP Server](../setup-guide/mcp.md) also counts. Read more about [core concepts](../core-concepts.md).

- Each **successful** execution of a Data Mart counts as **1 Report Run**, regardless of the volume of processed data.
- The Data Mart is executed on behalf of the customer's [Storage](../core-concepts.md#storage) within the dedicated OWOX BI Project, and processing costs are charged to the customer's Storage billing account.
- Report Runs are counted equally, whether the Data Mart was executed manually or via a [trigger](../core-concepts.md#trigger).
- The type of SQL statement (`SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) or whether it outputs a table or view does not affect the calculation of consumption units.
- When calculating consumption units for the Extension part, all Google Sheets documents and their respective sheets where the Data Mart (Query) is executed are considered.

#### Report Run sub-consumption units

For better transparency and flexibility, Report Runs are broken down into following sub-consumption units:

| **Consumption Unit** | **Sub-consumption Unit** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Consumption from licensed self-managed deployments

A self-managed deployment configured with a [managed license key](../deployment-guide/license-key-setup.md) sends successful Report Run consumption to the P2PDigital Data Marts Cloud project that issued the key. The calculation stays the same, while the **Credits consumption** page shows usage from each licensed deployment separately from native Cloud usage. Process Runs remain on the self-managed deployment and are not sent to Cloud for consumption billing.

## Process Run

### **How Are Process Runs Calculated?**

A **Process Run** means importing data from a [Source](../core-concepts.md#source) into **Storage**. Read more in [core concepts](../core-concepts.md).

- Each **successful** execution (e.g., delivering data from Facebook Ads API to BigQuery Storage or processing a {{prompt}} in the AI Layer) counts as **1 Process Run**.
- It makes no difference whether the Process Run was triggered manually or automatically — both are counted equally.
- The type of SQL query (`SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) does not impact the calculation of Process Runs.

#### Process Run sub-consumption units

For better transparency and flexibility, Process Runs are broken down into following sub-consumption units:

| **Consumption Unit** | **Sub-consumption Unit** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Process Run          | Platform Process Run     | Represents Process Runs executed in [OWOX BI Transformation](https://support.owox.com/hc/en-us/articles/33759051895060#OWOXBITransformation:TermsofUsage) on [bi.owox.com](https://bi.owox.com). Counts each successful execution of an individual Operation within a Transformation. |

## **FAQ**

- **Q:** How can I monitor the number of Runs per month?
  - **A:** In the app.p2pdigital.vn, open the **Credits consumption** page to see detailed usage.

- **Q:** Does querying data through the MCP Server consume credits?
  - **A:** Yes. Each successful `query_data_mart` call counts as one **MCP Query Run**, whatever number of rows it returns. Failed, cancelled, and timed-out queries cost nothing. Metadata tools stay free — listing data marts or inspecting fields never costs credits. See [What costs credits](../setup-guide/mcp.md#what-costs-credits) in the MCP Server guide.

- **Q:** Will my reports be updated if I exceed the limit on my subscription?
  - **A:** Yes! Reports will continue to be updated on schedule, and manual runs will work as usual — even if you exceed the limit. No interruptions.

- **Q:** How are monthly limits calculated if I pay for a year upfront?
  - **A:** Example: if you need up to 2,000 data refreshes per month, select _2000 Report Runs monthly_ on the payment page. This equals **100 credits per month** (1200 credits per year). Once your card is charged, you’ll get **100 credits every month** to run 2000 Report Runs. Simple and consistent.

- **Q:** What happens if I exceed the set limit?
  - **A:** Excess usage is billed on a Pay As You Go basis according to the rates on our [Pricing page](https://www.p2pdigital.vn/pricing-details/). For example: if you receive 100 credits (2000 Report Runs) per month but use 3000 Report Runs (150 credits), then the extra 50 credits will be charged to your card the following month. If this happens regularly, consider adjusting your plan — our Support Team will help you choose the best option.
