# Facebook Marketing Supported Endpoints and Fields

This page lists the Facebook Marketing endpoints and fields in the Facebook Ads connector. Use it to choose an endpoint and fields. Each endpoint lists its destination table, unique keys, and Meta reference. OWOX requests Meta Graph API version `v25.0`.

## Which Endpoint Should I Choose?

- For performance reporting such as spend, impressions, clicks, reach, conversions, and ROAS, start with **Ad Account Insights**.
- For reporting split by audience, placement, geography, product, or URL asset, use one of the **Ad Account Insights by ...** breakdown endpoints.
- For performance aggregated at the ad set or campaign level, use **Ad Insights by Ad Set** or **Ad Insights by Campaign**. These endpoints deduplicate reach to match Meta Ads Manager.
- For ad account metadata, use **Ad Account**.
- For ad names, statuses, campaign IDs, ad set IDs, and creative IDs, use **Ad Account Ads**.
- For creative metadata such as body text, image URL, object story ID, URL tags, or thumbnails, use **Ad Account Ad Creatives**.
- For users assigned to the ad account, use **Ad Account User**.

### Ad Account Insights Fields

Use the base field set with `ad-account/insights` and every `ad-account/insights-by-*` endpoint.

breakdown nodes remain unchanged until Meta compatibility is verified for each combination.

**Ad Insights by Ad Set** and **Ad Insights by Campaign** use a subset of these fields. Some ad-level fields do not apply at the ad set or campaign level.
