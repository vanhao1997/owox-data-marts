export class QueryDataMartTool implements McpToolDefinition<QueryDataMartInput> {
  readonly name = 'query_data_mart';
  readonly description = `Query an OWOX data mart and return its data rows in a compact, header-once table, plus server-side totals computed over all matching rows (ignoring the row limit). Each call costs credits.

Call get_data_mart_details_by_id first to get the data mart's exact field names and joinable/blended fields, then copy field names verbatim into fields — unless you already have that schema in context. Field names must be exact; never guess or invent them.

When building the query:
- Request only the fields relevant to the user's question — never request all fields.
- Use limit to control how many rows come back (1–1000, default 20). There is no offset/pagination: the tool returns a bounded subset.
- aggregations: SUM, COUNT, COUNT_DISTINCT, AVG, MIN, MAX, and percentiles P25/P50/P75/P95 — which of them a given field allows depends on the field's type and the data mart's per-field settings (see the matrix below). Group-by is implied by the non-aggregated fields you select.
- For “how many” questions, use COUNT or COUNT_DISTINCT (when the business meaning is unique entities) instead of returning raw rows and counting them yourself. Keep only dimensions the user asked to break the count by.
- date_buckets: bucket a date/timestamp field by DAY/WEEK/MONTH/QUARTER/YEAR (e.g. "revenue by month"). Only date-category fields can be bucketed; time_zone applies only to types with a time-of-day component (TIMESTAMP/DATETIME — not pure DATE), and never to a Calculated Field, whose bucket must be requested without one.

Which operators and aggregations fit which field type (using each field's "type" from get_data_mart_details_by_id):
${buildFieldTypeMatrixSection()}
A data mart can narrow a field's aggregations further ("only where enabled on the field") — get_data_mart_details_by_id returns each field's effective allowedAggregations; trust that over this table. Note COUNT/COUNT_DISTINCT are NOT available on number fields — to count rows per group, apply COUNT to a non-number field you already select that is always filled (an id field works well; COUNT skips NULLs, so a nullable field undercounts). To count UNIQUE records of a JOINED data mart (e.g. "how many distinct orders per customer"), do not aggregate its id column — instead select that source's own Unique Count field like any other field; get_data_mart_details_by_id (with_joined_fields) lists it among that source's joined fields whenever one is available. Copy its "name" (e.g. "orders__unique_count"), never its human-readable "displayName". It can be selected in "fields" and ordered by in "sort" (using that same exact name), but it cannot be used in filters, slices, aggregations, or date_buckets.
- sort: order the result rows by { field, direction } with direction "asc" or "desc"; rules apply in order (the first is the primary key). Each sorted field must also be listed in fields.
- fields must list every column the query uses, INCLUDING any field named in aggregations, date_buckets, or sort — a field you aggregate, bucket, or sort but omit from fields is rejected. Example — "revenue by month": fields ["ts", "revenue"], aggregations [{field: "revenue", function: "SUM"}], date_buckets [{field: "ts", unit: "MONTH"}]. (Filters are the exception: a filter may reference a field that is not in fields.)

Choosing between slices and filters (both are row-level predicates applied to raw values BEFORE any aggregation, so neither can threshold a total you asked for via "aggregations" — the one exception is a Calculated Field whose level is "metric", whose formula is already aggregated and whose filter therefore compares the aggregated value):
- slices (pre-join): narrow a JOINED data mart before it is blended in — criteria on a joined data mart's own fields only. Slices do NOT apply to the main data mart. More efficient — they reduce the joined volume before the join. A slice runs on the field's ORIGINAL value, so when get_data_mart_details lists a "sliceType" for the field, use operators valid for that pre-join type (not the field's blended-result "type").
- filters (post-join): row-level criteria on the blended result — use for anything on the MAIN data mart's fields or on a joined field. A filter on a field you also aggregate restricts which raw rows feed the aggregate (e.g. filter revenue > 0 → SUM over positive rows), NOT the group total.
- Rule: pre-narrowing a joined data mart's rows → slices; any other raw-row criterion → filters.
- Filtering by a total you asked for via "aggregations" (e.g. "groups whose SUM(revenue) > 100") is NOT supported — return all groups with their totals and let the caller compare. If the data mart already defines that quantity as a Calculated Field with level "metric", filter on THAT field instead and the threshold is applied to the aggregated value; list it in "fields" when you do.
- Example — "orders in the last 3 months" where orders is a joined data mart: the date range narrows the joined orders before the join → slices.

Using the results:
- Use metrics and totals from the response directly — never recompute a value already present (totals are computed server-side over all matching rows, so they stay correct even when rows are truncated).
- The totals block is separate from the rows.
- Totals keys are technical output column names. Match a totals key to column_metadata[].name, not to a business-friendly columns label.
- data_last_updated answers "how current is what I am looking at?". Read it carefully before repeating it:
  - data_last_updated_at is when the SOURCE TABLES last changed in the data warehouse. It is NOT a statement about which time period the data covers: a table rewritten today may have only backfilled figures for 2021. Say "the source tables were last updated on X", never "the data is fresh as of X".
  - null means unknown, not old and not fresh. Say the warehouse does not report it, and do not infer staleness from it.
  - coverage "partial" means some sources could not be read, so the real time can only be MORE recent than the one reported — present it as "at least as recent as X" and mention that the picture is incomplete. "unavailable" means nothing could be determined.
  - Mention it unprompted when the user's question depends on recency (today's numbers, "latest", trends up to now) or when they are about to act on the result.
  - Present every timestamp from this block (including per-table sources) in a business-friendly form — e.g. "August 4, 2026 at 09:46 UTC" — converted to the user's time zone when the conversation establishes one, otherwise in UTC with the zone named. Never show a raw ISO-8601 value like 2026-08-04T09:46:33Z.

If truncated is true, not all matching rows were returned: narrow the query (fewer fields, tighter slices/filters) or raise limit (up to 1000). Always use the source metadata in the response: name the Data Mart the answer came from, distinguish numbers calculated by OWOX from arithmetic you perform yourself, and clearly warn the user when rows were truncated.`;
