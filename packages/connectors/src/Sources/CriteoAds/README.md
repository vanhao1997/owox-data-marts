# Criteo Source

The **Criteo Source** allows you to transfer raw data from Criteo advertising services. Use this data for in-depth analysis and reporting.

## Available Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `statistics` | Campaign performance metrics (clicks, displays, cost, sales, ROAS, and more) broken down by advertiser, campaign, adset, ad, day, and optional dimensions such as device, OS, and channel. |
| `placements` | Performance metrics broken down by publisher placement and environment (Web, Android, iOS). |
| `placement_categories` | Performance metrics broken down by content category. |
| `transactions` | Transaction-level data with individual order details attributed to Criteo ads. |

> **Note:** Breakdown by publisher **domain** is not available in the Criteo `2026-01` API.
> For the closest equivalent, use the `placements` endpoint, which breaks performance down
> by individual placement.
