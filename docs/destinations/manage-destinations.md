# Destination Management

**Destination** is an interface or application used by business users to access the data.

Supported destinations include **Google Sheets**, **Data Studio**, **Microsoft Excel**, **Email**, **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, and **Google Chat**. In the near future, we will add support for OData-compatible tools like Tableau and Power BI.

## List of Destinations

> ☝️ **Email**, **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, and **Google Chat** Destinations available in the **Team plan** for [OWOX Cloud Editions](../editions/owox-cloud-editions.md), and in the **Enterprise plan** for the [Self-Managed Editions](../editions/self-managed-editions.md).

## Created Destinations on the Data Mart page

Each **Data Mart** can be linked to multiple **Destinations**, allowing the data to be used in different ways.

## Adding a New Destination

    - [Data Studio](supported-destinations/data-studio.md)
    - [Email](supported-destinations/email.md)
    - [Slack](supported-destinations/slack.md)
    - [Microsoft Teams](supported-destinations/microsoft-teams.md)
    - [Google Chat](supported-destinations/google-chat.md)
    - OData (Coming soon)

## Removing a Destination

To remove an existing **Destination** configuration:

1. Ensure all associated **Reports** referencing this **Destination** are deleted first:
   - Navigate to the **Data Marts** page and identify any Data Mart **Reports** using the **Destination**.
   - Delete each associated **Report** individually.
2. Go to the **Destinations** page via the main navigation panel.
3. Locate the **Destination** you want to delete in the table, click the item actions menu (represented by **...**), and click **Delete**.
4. Confirm the deletion to remove the **Destination**.

> ☝️ Attempting to delete a **Destination** with associated **Reports** will result in the error: "Cannot delete the destination because it is referenced by N existing report(s)".  
> Ensure all dependencies are removed before proceeding.

## Rotating a Data Studio Destination Secret Key

Use **Rotate Secret Key** when a Data Studio Destination's JSON Config was exposed or when you need to revoke existing Data Studio connector access.

1. Go to the **Destinations** page.
2. Locate the Data Studio Destination, click the item actions menu (represented by **...**), and click **Rotate Secret Key**.
3. Confirm the rotation. The previous key is invalidated, and the new JSON Config is copied to your clipboard.
4. Open the Data Studio connector configuration that uses this Destination and update it with the new JSON Config.

Any existing Data Studio data source that still uses the old JSON Config stops working until it is updated.

## Managing Owners

Each Destination has an **Owners** list — the team members responsible for its configuration.

- When a new Destination is created, the **creator is automatically assigned as an owner**.
- You can add or remove owners in the Destination configuration sheet (the **Owners** field after the Title).
- Only project members can be assigned as owners.
- Owners are saved together with the rest of the Destination configuration when you click **Save**.
- You can filter Destinations by owner in the list view using the **Owners** filter.

> ☝️ Ownership is currently informational — it does not affect access control. Any user with edit access can modify any Destination regardless of ownership.

---

## Key Considerations

- Each **Report** requires a single **Destination** association.
- For additional guidance or troubleshooting, explore the supported **Destination** configuration pages or join the [OWOX Community](https://github.com/vanhao1997/p2pdigital-data-marts/discussions).
