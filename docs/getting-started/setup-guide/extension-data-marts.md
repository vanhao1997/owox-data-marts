# Using Data Marts from OWOX Extension

## Why This Matters

You already use the [OWOX Reports Google Sheets Extension](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/owox_bigquery_data_marts/263000453832). You have Data Marts defined with SQL queries — running within your BigQuery project and sending data to Google Sheets. While this is a powerful way to handle ad-hoc reporting, you can do more with **[P2PDigital Data Marts](https://digitalreport.p2pdigital.io.vn)** while keeping your current setups fully functional:

- get reusable Insights defined by SQL with AI assistance
- unlock new delivery destinations like Data Studio, Email, Slack, MS Teams or Google Chat for your data
- simplify access and scheduling management at the organizational level
- gain full visibility into run history

> 💡 P2PDigital Data Marts detects your existing Extension Data Marts and automatically
> creates a **system storage** named after your GCP project ID. The storage type is “Google BigQuery (used in OWOX extension)”.
> This system storage cannot be added, edited, or deleted manually.

Take your Data Marts to the next level by completing these quick steps 👇

## Easy three-step Setup

Follow the steps below to complete the setup:

<https://customer-4geatlj66rtkaxtz.cloudflarestream.com/c2c31d3821d2e0c910fb1d9260323cb4/iframe>

1. [Select a storage](#step-1-select-your-storage)
2. [Grant access to Google BigQuery](#step-2-grant-access-to-google-bigquery)
3. [Publish your Data Marts](#step-3-publish-your-data-marts)

### Step 1: Select Your Storage

In P2PDigital Data Marts, go to **Storages**. Find the entry labeled **Google BigQuery (used in OWOX extension)** — it appears automatically, named after your GCP project ID.

> ☝️ The Title and Project ID of this storage are locked. Each GCP project gets
> exactly one system storage to maintain stable integration with the Extension.

### Step 2: Grant Access to Google BigQuery

Click on the storage entry to open its settings. Then:

1. Under **Authentication Method**, choose **Service Account JSON** or **Connect with Google**.
2. If using Service Account JSON, paste your [Service Account JSON key](https://docs.p2pdigital.io.vn/docs/storages/supported-storages/google-bigquery-used-in-owox-extension/#step-3-add-a-service-account) into the **Service Account** field.
3. Leave **Auto-detect location** selected unless you experience region-specific query errors.
4. Click **Save**.

The Service Account field shows a pasted JSON key with type, project_id, and private_key fields. An arrow points to the JSON key field. A Save button appears at the bottom.](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/0035e4e2-2ca2-49a2-e754-5d5eadcd1b00/public)

### Step 3: Publish Your Data Marts

After completing the storage setup, your extension Data Marts appear with **Draft** status. This means OWOX has imported their definitions but has not yet verified access. To make them operational, publish them.

To publish multiple Data Marts at once, open the three-dot menu on the storage row and select **Publish drafts**.

![P2PDigital Data Marts Storages list with a three-dot context menu open on the "smwyc-test-3" row (Google BigQuery used in OWOX extension). The menu shows three options: View details, Edit, and Publish drafts. An arrow points to the "Publish drafts" option.](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/b5d43691-a9a8-4c95-317f-92b7f3ff3e00/public)

Once published, each Data Mart is live: its output schema is visible and it can be connected to destinations.

> ☝️ Extension and web Data Marts are bidirectionally linked. Deleting a Data Mart
> in the web app also removes it from the extension. New Data Marts created in the
> web app do not sync back to the extension.

## Manage Data Marts in the List

If you have many data marts, use filters to quickly find the ones you need.

### Filter by Storage Type

![Filter by Storage Type](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/d4e17ce7-860d-42a3-932a-fd00bfb5e900/public)

To view only data marts created for the OWOX extension:

1. Click **Filters** above the list.
2. In the filter panel:
   - Select **Storage type**
   - Choose the operator **is**
   - Select **Google BigQuery (used in OWOX extension)**
3. Click **Apply filter**

This helps you focus on data marts used in the extension, especially if you also create data marts in the main app.

### Filter by Storage Title (GCP Project)

![Filter by Storage Title](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/75c9071f-43b0-48c6-8f00-8e4eb6390c00/public)

You can filter data marts by the GCP project:

- Use **Storage title** with the **contains** operator to search by project name  
- Use **Storage title** with the **is** operator to select a specific project from the list

### Combine Filters

![Filters combination](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/f8fe1030-00a7-4666-9c71-5553dfb61d00/public)

You can combine multiple filters to narrow the list, even if you have hundreds or thousands of data marts. As shown in the screenshot above, you can filter by Storage title, status, and Data Mart title to find the data marts you need.

## What You Can Do After Publishing

### Try Insights

<https://customer-4geatlj66rtkaxtz.cloudflarestream.com/ac0673d19f6eddc08b09a87dc012b8fa/iframe>

OWOX can analyze the output schema and run history of a Data Mart to surface anomalies, trends, or suggestions — using your existing data, with no additional pipeline required.

![Demo Google Sheets Report Data Mart detail page on the Insights tab. The tab is circled in red. The content area shows an empty state with "Create your first Insight" message, a "Generate Insight with AI" button, and a "+ Blank Insight" button.](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/df7097c5-40d0-4c14-c90c-583560479c00/public)

### Create Email-Based Reports

1. Add an [Email destination](https://docs.p2pdigital.io.vn/docs/destinations/supported-destinations/email/).
2. Open a published Data Mart and go to the **Destinations** tab.
3. Configure recipients and set a [Report Trigger](https://docs.p2pdigital.io.vn/docs/getting-started/setup-guide/report-triggers/) (daily, weekly, monthly, or on an interval).

At the scheduled time, OWOX queries BigQuery using your stored credentials, formats the result, and sends it by email.

### Build Reports in Data Studio

1. Add a [Data Studio destination](https://docs.p2pdigital.io.vn/docs/destinations/supported-destinations/data-studio/).
2. Open a published Data Mart and go to the **Destinations** tab.
3. Enable the **Available in Data Studio** toggle for that destination.
4. In Data Studio, connect using the P2PDigital Data Marts connector and the JSON Config token generated by the web app.

![Data Mart Destinations tab with a Data Studio destination row expanded. The "Available in Data Studio" toggle is switched on, and the status reads "Waiting for Data Studio to fetch data". An arrow points to the toggle.](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/0758c088-0ddc-4da7-1b1d-5e7823c33800/public)

> ☝️ Google Sheets uses **push mode** — OWOX sends data to a sheet on a schedule,
> so data is static between runs. Data Studio uses **pull mode** — data is
> fetched live from BigQuery each time you open the report, subject to the cache
> lifetime you configured.

### Set Up Connector-Based Data Marts

Your existing extension Data Marts query data already in BigQuery. [Connector-based Data Marts](https://docs.p2pdigital.io.vn/docs/getting-started/setup-guide/connector-data-mart/) go one step further: they pull raw data from ad platforms directly into BigQuery, which you can then query with your existing SQL Data Marts.
