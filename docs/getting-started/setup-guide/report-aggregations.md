# Report Aggregations and Totals

Summarize Data Mart data directly in a report — group by dimensions, apply aggregate functions to metrics, bucket dates, and get grand totals — without writing any SQL. OWOX builds the correct `GROUP BY` query for your storage and returns compact, ready-to-read numbers instead of raw rows.

> 💡 Aggregation runs **server-side in your data warehouse**, so the report returns one row per dimension combination (plus a separate totals block via the data API) rather than every underlying row. This keeps results small enough for Google Sheets and AI tools, and every number is backed by a query — nothing is recomputed downstream.

## What You Can Do

- Apply aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`, `COUNT_DISTINCT`, percentiles, and more) to a column.
- Apply **more than one** function to the same column — each becomes its own output column.
- **Group by** the remaining columns automatically (every non-aggregated selected column becomes a grouping key).
- **Bucket a date/timestamp** by day, week, month, quarter, or year (with an optional time zone).
- Add a **Unique Count** metric (`COUNT(DISTINCT primary key)`) — for the report's own Data Mart and for each joined one.
- Get **Totals** for numeric fields and any aggregated metric — each by its allowed functions — returned as a separate block.
- Govern, at the Data Mart level, which functions each field may use.

Works across all supported storages: **BigQuery, Athena, Snowflake, Redshift, and Databricks**.

## How It Works

An aggregated report follows a simple "group by all" rule:

- Any selected column **with** an aggregate function is a **metric** (it is collapsed by that function).
- Any selected column **without** a function is a **dimension** (it becomes a `GROUP BY` key).

So selecting `date`, `source`, and `sessionId` with `COUNT_DISTINCT` on `sessionId` produces one row per `date` + `source` combination, with the distinct session count per group — the same result you'd write by hand as `SELECT date, source, COUNT(DISTINCT sessionId) ... GROUP BY date, source`.

## Prerequisites

- A Data Mart whose schema is actualized (field types are known).
- A report on that Data Mart (for example, a Google Sheets or Looker Studio report).
- Output controls are available for the Data Mart's storage type (all five supported storages qualify).

## Data Mart Level: Roles and Allowed Aggregations

On the Data Mart's schema, each field carries a **role** and an **allowed-aggregations** set that govern what report builders may do with it:

- **Role (dimension or metric)** is derived from the field type by default — numeric fields default to _metric_, everything else to _dimension_. A field is either a grouping key or an aggregated metric in any given report.
- **Allowed aggregations** is the set of functions a report may apply to the field. The **Allowed aggregations** selector on the field row offers only the functions **supported** for that field type, with a sensible **default** subset pre-selected; you can **narrow the set per field, or turn aggregation off entirely**.

The supported menu and on-by-default subset per type:

| Field type                                | Default (on)                                         | Also available                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Numeric                                   | `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`                           | percentiles (`P25`/`P50`/`P75`/`P95`), `ANY_VALUE`   |
| Date / time                               | `MIN`, `MAX`                                         | `COUNT`, `COUNT_DISTINCT`, `STRING_AGG`, `ANY_VALUE` |
| Text                                      | `COUNT`, `COUNT_DISTINCT`, `STRING_AGG`, `ANY_VALUE` | `MIN`, `MAX`                                         |
| Boolean                                   | `COUNT`, `COUNT_DISTINCT`                            | `ANY_VALUE`                                          |
| Other (JSON, geography, array, struct, …) | `COUNT`                                              | `ANY_VALUE`                                          |

Note that `COUNT` / `COUNT_DISTINCT` are not offered for numeric fields, and `SUM` / `AVG` / percentiles are not offered for non-numeric fields. A report can only request a function the field allows.

## Report Level: Aggregate a Column

In the report's **Columns** picker, each eligible field shows a Σ (aggregation) control. Open it to choose one or more functions for that column. Aggregated columns are named `<column> | <TOKEN>` — the column name followed by an uppercase, spreadsheet-style function token — so the output is self-describing:

> `revenue` with `SUM` → output column **`revenue | SUM`**

![Google Sheets report with the P2PDigital Data Marts side panel open. The AGGREGATIONS list shows one entry — order_id aggregated by Max — and the order_id column row carries a Σ icon.

### Aggregate Function Reference

The **Output label** is the function's display name in the UI; the **Column token** is the uppercase suffix in the output column name (`<column> | <TOKEN>`).

| Function                      | Output label                                                 | Column token                     | Returns       | Use when                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUM`                         | Sum                                                          | `SUM`                            | numeric       | Total a numeric metric (revenue, spend).                   |
| `AVG`                         | Average                                                      | `AVG`                            | float         | Average a numeric metric.                                  |
| `MIN` / `MAX`                 | Min / Max                                                    | `MIN` / `MAX`                    | original type | Smallest/largest value, or earliest/latest date.           |
| `COUNT`                       | Count                                                        | `COUNT`                          | integer       | Number of rows in the group.                               |
| `COUNT_DISTINCT`              | Count Unique                                                 | `COUNTUNIQUE`                    | integer       | Number of unique values (e.g., distinct sessions).         |
| `STRING_AGG`                  | Combined                                                     | `STRINGAGG`                      | string        | Concatenate text values into one comma-separated list.     |
| `ANY_VALUE`                   | Sample                                                       | `ANYVALUE`                       | original type | A single representative value (cheaper than `STRING_AGG`). |
| `P25` / `P50` / `P75` / `P95` | 25th Percentile / Median / 75th Percentile / 95th Percentile | `P25` / `MEDIAN` / `P75` / `P95` | float         | Distribution percentiles of a numeric metric.              |

Which functions appear depends on the field type and the Data Mart's **allowed aggregations** for that field.

## Multiple Aggregations per Column

You can apply several functions to one column — for example `SUM` and `AVG` of `amount`. Each function produces its own output column (`amount | SUM`, `amount | AVG`), so you can compare them side by side in a single report.

![Google Sheets report with the P2PDigital Data Marts side panel open. The AGGREGATIONS list shows four entries for the revenue field — aggregated by Sum, Average, Min, and Max. The sheet shows corresponding output columns revenue | SUM, revenue | AVG, revenue | MIN, and revenue | MAX with matching values in each row.](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/d6c5e5e2-e570-4501-9f6d-8ee1f9903e00/public)

## Group By (Dimensions)

Grouping is implicit: every selected column that has **no** aggregation becomes a `GROUP BY` key. There is no separate "group by" toggle — pick the dimensions you want as plain columns and aggregate the rest. If you select only metrics (no dimensions), the report collapses to a single grand-total row.

## Date Bucketing

To answer questions like _"revenue by month"_ or _"sessions by week"_, bucket a date or timestamp dimension instead of grouping by the raw (daily) value. Choose a granularity — **Day, Week, Month, Quarter, or Year** — for the date column. For **timestamp/datetime** columns you can optionally set an **IANA time zone** (for example, `America/New_York`) so values are converted to that zone before truncation; without one, no conversion is applied. (Pure `DATE` columns have no time-of-day, so no time zone applies.)

![Edit report panel with a popover open on the order_timestamp column. "Group by bucket" is set to WEEK and "Time zone (optional)" to America/New_York, with "Or aggregate by" Min/Max checkboxes below.

## Unique Count

The **Unique Count** row (at the bottom of the Data Mart's field list) adds a `COUNT(DISTINCT <primary key>)` metric to the report. It counts unique entities by the Data Mart's primary key, including composite keys.

> Not to be confused with the per-column **Count Unique** (`COUNT_DISTINCT`) aggregation above — Unique Count is a single report-wide metric keyed on the primary key, not applied to an individual column.
>
> ⚠️ Unique Count requires the Data Mart to have a primary key. Without one the row is shown disabled, with a tooltip explaining what to fix.
>
> A key column marked **Hidden for Report** still counts: counting distinct values of a column puts nothing in the output, so there is nothing to hide. A key column that has **disconnected** from the source is different — the whole metric is withheld, because counting by the rest of a composite key would merge records the full key keeps apart.

![Create new report panel with the column list scrolled to the bottom. A checked "Unique Count" row appears below the fields with a Σ icon, and a tooltip reads "Auto-generated column — counts the distinct values of the primary key." An arrow points to the Unique Count checkbox.](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/28565768-b0c0-4f3b-c17c-51b224b56f00/public)

### Unique Count per Joined Data Mart

Every [joined Data Mart](./joinable-data-marts.md) offers a Unique Count of its own, at the bottom of that Data Mart's group in the **Columns** picker. In the picker it is simply `Unique Count` — the group heading above already names the Data Mart — with a tooltip naming that Data Mart and the key columns being counted. In the produced file it carries the Data Mart's name like any other joined field: `Unique Count (Orders)` in Google Sheets, `Orders Unique Count` everywhere else. It counts distinct records of **that** Data Mart by **its** primary key, composite keys included.

This answers questions the join alone cannot: _"how many orders per customer"_, or _"how many unique products across a customer's orders"_ — without adding the order or product key to the report as a column. Select as many as you need; each joined Data Mart contributes its own column — and each one its own `SELECT DISTINCT` pass over that Data Mart, so on a pay-per-scan warehouse a report that ticks several costs more to run.

> ⚠️ A joined Unique Count can be **selected** and **sorted by**, like the report's own Data Mart's Unique Count. It cannot be filtered or aggregated on.

When a joined Data Mart cannot offer the metric, the row is still shown, disabled, with a tooltip naming that Data Mart and explaining why. The primary key is defined on that Data Mart's **Data Setup** page:

| Why it is disabled                                           | What to fix                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No primary key is set on that Data Mart                      | Mark the key field(s) as **PK** in that Data Mart's output schema.           |
| Part of the primary key is disconnected                      | Reconnect the missing key field, or actualize that Data Mart's schema.       |
| The primary key is a nested field (for example `user.id`)    | Unique Count cannot key on a nested field — declare a top-level key instead. |
| The primary key is nested **and** part of it is disconnected | Both need fixing — a top-level key, all of whose fields are connected.       |

## Counting rows in a group

An aggregated report contains only the columns you select — no `Row Count` column is added on its own. To see how many underlying rows each group stands for, apply the **Count** aggregate function. Use a column that is always filled, such as an ID column. To count unique entities instead, use a Unique Count.

## Totals

**Totals** are a per-column summary over the full filtered dataset, with no grouping. Totals cover every selected **numeric** field — aggregated by **all of its allowed functions** (for example `Sum`, `Average`, `Min`, and `Max` of `revenue`) — plus any **non-numeric field the report aggregates as a metric** (for example `Count Unique` on a text `country` column, giving its distinct count). `Sample` (`ANY_VALUE`) and `Combined` (`STRING_AGG`) are **never** part of Totals: a single representative value or a full-column concatenation is not a meaningful grand total. Totals are computed **in the warehouse** by a separate query and returned as a **separate block**, so they stay accurate and are never recomputed from the displayed rows. [Calculated fields](./calculated-fields.md) are the one exception to the rule above: OWOX never invents a Totals aggregation for a formula, so a calculated field appears in Totals as its own formula recomputed over the whole dataset, and a calculated dimension the report aggregates carries no Totals value at all.

Totals are produced even when the report itself is not grouped, and fields from joined Data Marts are included on the same basis (numeric fields automatically; non-numeric ones when the report aggregates them). `Unique Count` is not part of Totals.

> ⚠️ Totals are returned in the report **data API** (used by the MCP server and HTTP destinations), not written into Google Sheets or Looker Studio report output.

## View Generated SQL

The SQL OWOX builds for an aggregated report is fully transparent — preview it from the report to see the exact `GROUP BY`, aggregate expressions, and date-truncation per your storage dialect, or copy it into a standalone SQL-based Data Mart.

![Data Mart "Orders" on the Destinations tab with the Google Sheets section expanded, showing one "Google Sheets report" row. An arrow points to the Preview SQL icon button in the row's actions, with a "Preview SQL" tooltip visible.](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/112a1da6-5bbd-4825-19ad-a7b50d37f700/public)

## Limitations and Considerations

- A field is either a dimension or an aggregated metric within a single report — not both.
- Aggregated and date-bucketed reports require an explicit column selection (the columns to group by and aggregate).
- Conditional aggregation (`COUNT(DISTINCT … WHERE …)`) and pivoting values into columns are not supported — model these as pre-aggregated Data Marts instead.
- `Count Unique` (`COUNT_DISTINCT`) and `Combined` (`STRING_AGG`) are not available for complex column types (JSON, geography, array, struct, and similar) — those values are neither comparable nor reliably text-convertible across warehouses, so only `Count` and `Sample` apply.
- A date bucket's time zone affects only the bucketing. Date **filters** on the same field are evaluated in the warehouse's session time zone, so rows near midnight can land on different sides of a bucket boundary than of a filter boundary. Keep this in mind when combining a non-session time-zone bucket with a date filter on the same field.
- Percentiles (`P25`/`P50`/`P75`/`P95`) are **approximate** on BigQuery and Athena and **exact** (continuous-interpolated) on Redshift, Snowflake, and Databricks, so the same percentile can differ slightly between storages.
- A Unique Count — the report's own Data Mart's or a **joined** one's — can be selected as a column and used as a sort column, but not in a filter or as the input to another aggregation.
- Unique Count ignores rows whose primary key is **empty** — an empty key is not an identity, so such rows are neither counted nor merged together. Declare a primary key only on columns that are genuinely unique and always filled.
- **Turning on any Unique Count makes the report aggregated.** The remaining selected columns become `GROUP BY` keys, so a report that returned one row per underlying record now returns one row per combination of those columns. That is what makes the count meaningful per group, but it is not announced: the report looks the same while each row now stands for several records.
- For joined Data Marts, report-level aggregation is applied **on top of** the join roll-up; see [Joinable Data Marts](./joinable-data-marts.md).
- **Totals over joined fields are approximate**, because they re-aggregate the per-join roll-up rather than raw rows: `AVG`/percentiles are unweighted (an average of per-join averages), and a `Count Unique` over a joined **text** field counts distinct rolled-up values (by default a concatenation of the joined rows), not distinct raw values. Totals over the Data Mart's own (native) fields are exact.
