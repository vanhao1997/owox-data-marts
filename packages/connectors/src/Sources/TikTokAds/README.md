# TikTok Ads Source

The **TikTok Ads Source** allows you to transfer raw data from TikTok advertising service. Use this data for in-depth analysis and reporting.

## Getting Started

To begin, check out [**GETTING STARTED.md**](GETTING_STARTED.md) for step-by-step instructions.

## Available Data

| Node | Description | Destination table |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `advertiser` | Advertiser account details, including name, company, and currency. | `tiktok_ads_advertiser` |
| `campaigns` | Campaign settings, status, budget, and schedule. | `tiktok_ads_campaigns` |
| `ad_groups` | Ad group settings, bid strategy, optimization goal, placement, and targeting schedule. | `tiktok_ads_ad_groups` |
| `ads` | Individual ad creatives, statuses, and campaign/ad group links. | `tiktok_ads_ads` |
| `ad_insights` | Daily performance metrics at the selected TikTok Ads data level. | `tiktok_ads_ad_insights` |
| `ad_insights_by_country` | Daily performance metrics at the selected TikTok Ads data level, broken down by country. | `tiktok_ads_ad_insights_by_country` |
| `audiences` | Custom audiences, including type, size, validity status, and expiration. | `tiktok_ads_audiences` |

## Data Level for Performance Nodes

`Data Level` controls the reporting grain for `ad_insights` and `ad_insights_by_country`. The default is `AUCTION_AD`.

| Data Level | `ad_insights` unique key fields | `ad_insights_by_country` unique key fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AUCTION_ADVERTISER` | `stat_time_day`, `advertiser_id` | `stat_time_day`, `country_code`, `advertiser_id` |
| `AUCTION_CAMPAIGN` | `campaign_id`, `stat_time_day`, `advertiser_id` | `campaign_id`, `stat_time_day`, `country_code`, `advertiser_id` |
| `AUCTION_ADGROUP` | `adgroup_id`, `stat_time_day`, `advertiser_id` | `adgroup_id`, `stat_time_day`, `country_code`, `advertiser_id` |
| `AUCTION_AD` | `ad_id`, `stat_time_day`, `advertiser_id` | `ad_id`, `stat_time_day`, `country_code`, `advertiser_id` |

`advertiser_id` is always a unique key: `AdvertiserIDs` can list several advertisers writing into the same destination table, and only `advertiser_id` tells their rows apart at `AUCTION_ADVERTISER`, which has no other per-advertiser dimension.

The field selector keeps the required unique-key fields selected for the chosen data level, so choose the data level before customizing fields. If a connector has already loaded data, changing `Data Level` can make new rows merge against a different key structure in the same destination table. Use a new Data Mart or destination table when changing the reporting grain.
