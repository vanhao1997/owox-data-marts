# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in P2PDigital Data Marts. When an event is triggered, OWOX sends an HTTP POST request with a JSON payload to your configured URL.

## Setting Up a Webhook

1. Navigate to **Notifications** in the left sidebar.
2. Select the notification type you want to configure (e.g., _Failed runs_).
3. Enter your endpoint URL in the **Webhook URL** field.
4. Click **Test** to verify your endpoint is reachable.
5. Click **Save** to activate the webhook.

---

## IP Allowlist

All webhook requests originate from a fixed IP address. If your endpoint is behind a firewall or requires IP allowlisting, add the following address:

```text
34.38.103.182
```

---

## Request Format

Every webhook request is a `POST` with the following headers:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `User-Agent`  | `OWOX-DataMarts-Webhook/1.0` |
| `X-Webhook-ID` | Unique event ID (UUID) |
| `X-Event-Type` | Event type string (e.g. `owox.data-marts.webhook.data_mart.run.failed`) |

---

## Payload Structure

All events share the same envelope:

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "version": "1",
  "event": "<event-type>",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "isTest": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique event ID (UUID). Use for deduplication. |
| `version` | string | Payload schema version. Currently `"1"`. |
| `event` | string | Event type identifier. |
| `timestamp` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event was generated. |
| `isTest` | boolean | Present and `true` only for test events sent via the **Test** button. Omitted for real events. |
| `data` | object | Event-specific payload. |

  }
}

## Responding to Webhooks

Your endpoint must return a `2xx` HTTP status code within **10 seconds**. Any other response or a timeout is treated as a failure.

---

## Testing Your Endpoint

Use the **Test** button in the notification settings to send a sample event to your endpoint. Test events have `"isTest": true` in the payload and use the same structure as real events, so you can use them to validate your integration immediately.

---

## Receiver Changes and Webhooks

Webhooks are sent independently of the receiver list — as long as a webhook URL is configured and the notification is enabled, events will be delivered to your endpoint regardless of whether any email receivers are configured. See [Notification Settings](./notification-settings.md) for how receivers are managed, including [automatic subscription](./notification-settings.md#automatic-subscription) of new project members.
