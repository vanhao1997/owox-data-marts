## Set Up the Connector

1. Select **Connector** as the input source type.  
2. Click **Set up connector** and choose **Google Ads**.  

3. Enter your **Customer ID**.
   > ⚠️ This is the ID of the account from which you want to retrieve data.

4. Enter your **Login Customer ID** if you access the selected customer through a Manager (MCC) account.
   > This is the ID of the Manager (MCC) account. Leave it empty when authenticating directly as the same account.

5. Fill in the required fields depending on your chosen authentication type.
(If you need help obtaining any of these values, please refer to the detailed instructions in the [CREDENTIALS](CREDENTIALS.md) guide.)

### For **OAuth2 Authentication** (with OAuth button)

If your P2PDigital Data Marts instance has OAuth pre-configured by an administrator, you will see a **"Sign in with Google"** button. This is the recommended approach — it handles token exchange automatically.

1. Click **Sign in with Google**.
2. In the popup, select your Google account and grant access.
3. The following OAuth scopes are requested:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords` — access to Google Ads data
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email` — to display your connected email
4. After successful authorization, you will see **"Connected as your-email\@example.com"**.
5. Fill in the remaining fields:
   - **Customer ID** – the ID of the **ad account** you want to retrieve data from.

> ℹ️ The Developer Token, Client ID, and Client Secret are managed by your instance administrator via environment variables and do not need to be entered manually.

### For **OAuth2 Authentication** (manual credentials)

If OAuth is not pre-configured, you can enter credentials manually:

- **Customer ID** – enter the ID of the **ad account** you want to retrieve data from.
  You can find it in the top-right corner when viewing the specific ad account in Google Ads.
- **Refresh Token** – paste the refresh token you generated using **OAuth Playground** in the Credentials guide.
- **Client ID** – enter the Client ID from the OAuth client you created in **Google Cloud Console → Google Auth Platform → Clients**.
- **Client Secret** – enter the Client Secret shown when creating your OAuth client, or use the value stored in the downloaded JSON.
- **Developer Token** – paste the Developer Token from your **Google Ads API Center** in your MCC account.

### For **Service Account Authentication**

- **Customer ID** – enter the ID of the **ad account** you want to retrieve data from.
  You can find it in the top-right corner when viewing the specific ad account in Google Ads.
- **Service Account Key** – paste the full JSON key file content you created in **Google Cloud Console → IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Manage Keys**.
- **Developer Token** – paste the Developer Token from your **Google Ads API Center** in your MCC account.

Leave all other fields as default, then click **Next** to continue.

## Configure Data Import

1. Choose one of the available endpoints.
2. Select the required **fields**.
3. Specify the **dataset** where the data will be stored, or leave it as default.
4. Click **Finish**, then **Publish Data Mart**.

> ⚠️ **Important Notice:**  
> If you select any **stats endpoint** (e.g., *Campaign Stats*, *Ad Group Stats*, *Keyword Stats*, etc.), the **Customer ID** must be an **ad account**, not your MCC. When you set a **Login Customer ID**, it must be **different** from the Customer ID; when querying the ad account directly, leave **Login Customer ID** empty.
> Stats data **cannot be retrieved from an MCC (manager) account** — you must specify an **ad account’s Customer ID** as the data source.  
> All **non-stats endpoints** allow data retrieval using an MCC Customer ID.
