# How to obtain the Refresh Token for Linkedin Ads Source

To connect to LinkedIn Ads through the API, you need to create an app, request access to the API, and generate a refresh token. Follow the steps below to complete the process.

## Step 1: Create a LinkedIn App

Visit the [LinkedIn Developer portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/ ).

Click the **Create App** button.

## Step 2: Verify the App

Go to the **Settings** tab and click the **Verify** button. Share the link with the administrator of your LinkedIn company page. The administrator must verify the app to grant it access to company data.

 Please, ensure that the app is verified:

## Step 3: Request Access to the API

Once your app is verified, navigate to the **Products** tab and request access to the necessary APIs.

If you need access to **advertising data**: to retrieve campaign performance, audience insights, ad creatives, and other paid media metrics, request access to the **Advertising API**.

If you see the following error message:  
_"There aren't any scopes available for this app. Select another app or visit your app's product settings to request API access,"_  
make sure you've requested and received approval for the necessary APIs in **Step 3**.

Select the required scopes for **advertising data** access:

- `r_ads`  
- `r_ads_reporting`

After selecting the appropriate scopes, click **Request access token**.

## Step 5: Save the Refresh Token

After the token is generated, **copy and securely store your Refresh Token**.

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> Make sure you are copying the **Refresh Token**, not the **Access Token**.  
> The **Refresh Token** is located at the **bottom** of the page.
