# GA4 Pageviews Data Mart - One Row Per Pageview

This SQL defines **pageviews in GA4 in a clean and reusable way**, using the GA4 BigQuery export data.

In GA4, pageviews are stored as `page_view` events — which means there is **no pageviews table by default**.  
If you build reports without defining your pageview logic centrally, every dashboard ends up telling a different story.

This script standardizes pageview logic into a **single, reusable Data Mart**:

- One row = one pageview
- Includes visitor & session identifiers
- Extracts `page_location`, `page_title`, and `page_referrer`
- Derives `page_host` and `page_path`
- Captures engagement time (ms)
- Ranks pageviews in each session
- Flags whether the pageview is the **landing page** of the session

Use this as the foundation for reporting in:

- Google Sheets  
- Data Studio  
- Tableau / Power BI  
- AI assistants and analytics workflows  

> **Tip:** Create a Data Mart in [P2PDigital Data Marts](https://www.p2pdigital.vn/app-signup), paste this SQL, and reuse it across destinations — no more copying queries between dashboards.
