 * The canvas "check Data Last Updated for what I see" action from the product meeting: measures

 *
 * Chunked requests, not one per node. The expensive part of a lookup is per-storage — resolving
 * credentials and standing up a warehouse client — and a canvas is already filtered to a single
 * storage, so batching lets the backend pay that once per chunk instead of once per Data Mart.
 * Results are applied to the cache in ONE write after the last chunk, so the flow graph rebuilds
 * (and re-runs fitView) once rather than flickering per chunk.
 *
 * Data Marts the backend could not measure are simply absent from the response and keep their
 * previous value. Progress shows on the nodes themselves — every Data Last Updated icon spins
 * while `isRefreshing` is true, the same affordance a RUNNING quality run gets — so success
 * needs no toast: the icons settle into the fresh values. A sweep that changes nothing does
 * speak up, though: on a storage without a resolver "measured nothing" is the guaranteed
 * outcome, and spinning icons that stop with no visible change would read as broken. Failure
 * stays honest too — a partially-failed sweep reports how much it actually covered.
