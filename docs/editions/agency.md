## Why We Built This

Running a successful agency means growing your client base – but most existing marketing analytics tools for agencies punish you for growth. And that leads to an exponential SaaS subscription cost.

In addition, agencies often face the following challenges:

- Each client has its **own set of ad platforms** & sales CRM.
- Data analysts rewrite SQL queries and **build new dashboards from scratch** for every client.
- **Data privacy concerns**: you can't get permission to provide the client's credentials to 3rd-party data vendors.
- Lack of control over reporting logic, and each client waits for their own custom metrics.
- Data blending challenges – one extra column needed means three more tasks to handle.
- Analytics bandwidth is a bottleneck – reporting slows down when key people are out.

P2PDigital Data Marts Community Edition already gets you mostly covered. But the **Agency Edition** is designed specifically for reporting to multiple clients with:

- multiple projects
- advanced access control
- full logging
- conversational UI

It empowers agencies to automate all client analytics & reports delivery without reinventing the wheel.

This approach allows agencies to **scale operations efficiently** and onboard new clients quickly without starting from scratch.
