# Email Notifications

Email notifications keep your team informed about Data Mart run results without having to check the dashboard manually. P2PDigital sends a single batched email covering all relevant runs within the configured [Grouping Delay](./notification-settings.md#grouping-delay) window.

---

## What Triggers an Email

An email is sent when:

- At least one Data Mart run matches the notification type (failed or successful) within the grouping window, **and**
- The notification is enabled, **and**
- At least one receiver is configured.

> ☝️ Make sure that the configured notification sender is not in your block list, and that emails do not end up in your spam folder.

## Email Content

The email contains a summary of all matching runs grouped by Data Mart.

![Example "Failed runs" email showing the email subject, project name, and a list of Data Marts with their failed runs and error messages](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/928fd39b-352f-47b2-f39b-6a90e2315100/public)

For **Failed runs** emails, each Data Mart section shows:

- Run timestamp and duration
- Error message(s) that caused the failure

![Example "Successful runs" email showing the email subject, project name, and a list of Data Marts with their successful runs](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/e118d72a-cfc5-4738-3ce7-b5d2ac9df000/public)

## Configuring Email Receivers

1. Open **Notifications** in the left sidebar.
2. Click on the notification row you want to configure.
3. In the **Receivers** field, select the project members who should receive the email.
4. Click **Save**.

> ☝️ Only project members with email notifications enabled will receive emails. If a member has notifications disabled in their account settings, they will appear with a warning badge in the receivers list.

New project members with **Admin** or **Technical User** roles are automatically added as receivers. Members who manually unsubscribe will not be re-added automatically. See [Automatic Subscription](./notification-settings.md#automatic-subscription) for details.
